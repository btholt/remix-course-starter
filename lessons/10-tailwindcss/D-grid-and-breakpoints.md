This is probably what most sold me on Tailwind CSS. Let's say we want to make a nice sort of tiled layout for our search results for our pets. Tailwind makes this so easy. Head to Results.js and let's see this.

```javascript
// replace outermost div
<div className="grid gap-4 grid-cols-2">[â€¦]</div>
```

lol what

That just feels like it's cheating, right? Wow.

- `grid` puts you into `display: grid`.
- `gap-4` gives you the gutters between with the number representing how big.
- `grid-cols-2` says how many you want per row.

But we're not done here. Let's make it _responsive_ too.

```javascript
<div className="grid gap-4 grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">[â€¦]</div>
```

ðŸ¤¯

- The `sm:` is the small breakpoint which is larger than 640px apply this style (these can be adjusted and renamed)
- The `lg:` is the large breakpoint is larger than 1024px. There's also md, xl, and 2xl too.

We just did a fully responsive grid layout with no work. My much younger self is very upset by how much work I had to put into doing this right. This is so much easier than it used to be.
